In Yosys, the command synth is a convenience command that performs default RTL-to-gate-level synthesis in a generic, technology-independent way. Think of it as a shortcut.

No standard cell mapping or liberty file use happens in synth — it keeps logic in a generic format (good for viewing and analysis).

When to Use synth:
You want a quick RTL synthesis
You’re preparing for mapping with ABC later
You don’t want to deal with technology libraries yet


THE bellow is the script (Just good for viewing the schematic without standard libary cells and mapping )-

  synth -top alu
